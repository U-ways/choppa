### User story

A user story must have just the right level of detail. It should be a high-level requirement with additional detail added to the accustomed acceptance criteria.

**Here is a simple template that is widely used while creating user stories:**

> As a (type of user), I want (some goal), so that (reason).

The point of the user story is to clearly state the feature desired from the point of view of the user.

**Example of a user story:**

_"As a product manager. I want to score potential ideas. So that I can decide what to include in my product roadmap."_

### Acceptance Criteria

In Agile, acceptance criteria refers to a set of predefined requirements that must be met in order to mark a user story complete.

**What are a few traits of effective acceptance criteria?**
- Acceptance criteria should be testable. Since these requirements help formulate the definition of done for your engineers, they need to be easy to test. And the results of these tests must leave no room for interpretation. Tests should reveal straightforward yes/no or pass/fail results.
- Criteria should be clear and concise. You aren’t writing comprehensive documentation here. Keep your criteria as simple and straightforward as possible.
- Everyone must understand your acceptance criteria. Your criteria are useless if your developers can’t understand it. If you’re unsure about whether something is clear, take the time to ask and make adjustments until things are clear.
- Acceptance criteria should provide a user perspective. Acceptance criteria is a means of looking at the problem at hand from a customer’s standpoint. It should be written in the context of a real user’s experience.

**We follow the **Given/When/Then** Acceptance Criteria format:**

The Given/When/Then style of user story requirements is similar to the traditional formatting for user stories themselves. The standard user story follows the template: “As a (intended user), I want to (intended action), so that (goal/outcome of the action).” User acceptance criteria in given/when/then format follows the template: “Scenario: (explain scenario). Given (how things begin), when (action taken), then (outcome of taking action).”

**Here is a follow-up example of a Given/When/Then acceptance criteria:**

- Given that I have added two or more ideas and scored them using the Benefit vs Cost scoring model:
- When I click the Rank button
- Then ideas are sorted with the top-scoring ideas at the top.
