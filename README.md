Choppa is an Agile team rotation tool based on [The Spotify Model][1].  
It provides an easy-to-use web-based interface to rotate and track your team members.

## What is The Spotify Model?

The Spotify model is a people-driven, autonomous approach for scaling agile that emphasises the importance of culture and network. It has helped Spotify, and other organisations increase innovation and productivity by focusing on autonomy, communication, accountability, and quality.

The Spotify model was first introduced to the world in 2012, which introduced the radically simple way Spotify approached agility. Since then, the Spotify model generated a lot of buzz and became popular in the agile transformation space. Part of its appeal is that it focuses on organising around work rather than following a specific set of practices. In traditional scaling frameworks, specific practices (e.g. daily standups) are how the framework is executed, whereas the Spotify model focuses on how businesses can structure an organisation to enable agility.

## Why should you do team rotations?

It's not uncommon, for example, for a successful software project to last many years. After all, successful software is never complete. There's always a new feature to add or an existing component to freshen up. 

But should the original team last just as long?  
Team rotation opportunities can be found in successful, happy, and innovative teams.

### Benefits of Team Rotations

There are lots of reasons to change up your team:

- **New ideas**: New team members bring a beginner's mindset to the problem space and commonly inject positive new ideas and observations.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Assuming the person rotating off the project isn't leaving your organisation, rotating team members can help you extend the knowledge base of people who can effectively work on this successful product.
- **Individual energy and team morale**: Variety is the spice of life. The existing feature challenges of the product are exciting and fresh for the new developer. This energy is contagious, and it can provide a boost to the entire team.

Many existing tech-based companies recommend team rotation:

## Why should you use Choppa for team member rotation?

We mixed the structural concept of The Spotify Model and the iterative nature of Agile to introduce a chapter-based member rotation to build on the network-driven philosophy of The Spotify Model. This opens the possibility of maximising knowledge sharing and creating a more robust workplace culture within an organisation.

Instead of using the traditional Excel spreadsheet, pen and paper, or just relaying on memory to rotate your team members, you can use Choppa to do the hard crunching for you. Choppa provides you with team formation tracking and different rotation strategies that can utilise previous member formations to place members where they could have the most significant impact on the team.

We do this by considering the time spent in each squad, the different chapters a member got exposed to, and the various tribe members you have interacted with based on the formation history collected. This eliminates bias when rotating team members based on single user preferences, and saves you time from input and tracking chores automated in this application.
